# Josh's dotfiles
I recently purchased a new Mac mini for myself and a MacBook Air for my wife and while looking for ways to keep settings and files in sync, I came across the concept of dotfiles.

In my previous job as a System Administrator, I was big on scripting and automation. I'd rather take a little extra time to create something reusable with the hope that it will save time and hassle in the future. This also allows for a kind of documented configuration without having to remember all of the steps and changes required.

So it seemed like a nobrainer to take many of the concepts I've used at work and apply them to my personal systems.

This probably doesn't need to be in github, but why not!

## Goals
I find that if I don't set clear goals, I won't stay on track.

- [ ] Install software on new and existing computers
- [ ] Set default OS preferences
- [ ] Set application preferences
- [ ] Sync application preferences between systems

## Reference/Inspiration
There's many great resouces out there and I'm using them as inspiration.
